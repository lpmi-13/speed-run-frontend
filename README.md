# Speed Run Frontend

This is the frontend for the 3-tier webapp speedrun on [Iximiuz Labs](https://labs.iximiuz.com).

It serves the built assets via nginx and passes backend requests to the [speed run backend](https://github.com/lpmi-13/speed-run-backend).

## Running locally

You'll need the backend running (see: link above) in order to actually fetch anything.

```bash
npm i
npm start
```
